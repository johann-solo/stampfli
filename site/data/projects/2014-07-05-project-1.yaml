description: All Consortium members, regardless of their specialisation,have a strong brand marketing background. The principles of brand creation and brandbuilding predicates everything we do.<br><br>We believe that brands are simply promises. We believe thatearning the respect of your customers is fundamental to creating a community ofengaged persons. If customers respect who you are and what you do then they willendorse and recommend your brand to others in their community/tribe. Theybasically are saying that, “I get whatyou are doing and I like it”.<br><br>To do this, we create a brand plan or project plan based on clearfocussed objectives. Whether you are a new company, you are introducing a newproduct/service, or venturing into a new export market we can craft a comprehensive plan for you with the expertise from our members.<br><br>We can take you to the next level, where we develop the relationship with your customer to the point of loyalty. This is the hardest phase especially today when customers tend to be fickle, follow the latest fads and jump to the next best thing in a snap. This step requires staying on the pulse of the market,following needs, desires, trends and competitor activity. It also requires consistent and frequent communication to maintain engagement.<br><br>In today’s digital world you cannot take for granted that thecustomers you have today will be there tomorrow. Information is free and global.On line shopping has made competition more fierce. Brands that were unique in onecountry are soon trailed by a score of me toos from around the world once thereis a money to be made. It is becoming harder to maintain brand differentiation,even though it is more critical than ever to do so. <br><br>Our goal is bring all of this all together – create anddefine winning brands, nurture brand relationships, develop brand respect,drive engagement, incite endorsement and maintain brand loyalty.
