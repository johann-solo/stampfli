description: All Consortium members, regardless of their specialisation, have a brand marketing underpinning. As such the principles of brand creation and brand building predicates most everything we do.</br></br>We believe that brands are promises. We also believe that earning the respect of your customers is fundamental to creating a community of engaged persons. If customers respect who you are and what you do then they will endorse and recommend your brand to their community/tribe. They basically are saying that, “I get you and what are doing. My people need to know about you too!”.</br></br>To do this, we create a brand plan or project plan based on clear, focussed objectives. Whether you are a new company, you are introducing a new product/service, or venturing into a new export market we can craft a comprehensive plan for you with the expertise from Consortium members. </br></br>We can help take you to the next level to develop your relationship with your customers to create strong respect and loyalty. The challenge today is due to the fact that customers are very fickle and everything in the world is moving in hyperdrive. Innovations in fashion, technology, entertainment and lifestyle products has created a culture of people jumping out of the latest “it” thing as fast as they jumped into it. Staying on the pulse of the market, following needs, desires, trends and competitor activity is important to stay in the lead and remain relevant . It also more important to remain consistent with impactful communication to maintain engagement.</br></br>You cannot take for granted that your customers today will be yours tomorrow. Information is accessible, free and global and on-line shopping has made competitive activity even more fierce. Brands that were once unique are soon trailed by a score of ‘me-toos’ from around the world. It is becoming harder to maintain brand differentiation, making it more critical to do so than ever before.</br></br>The present pandemic crisis has also posed new challenges as many companies have been forced to re-examine their businesses amidst extreme uncertainty. Many are still pondering about what to do now, how will they remain open and what do they have to do to be relevant for the undefined future. </br></br>The Stämpfli Consortium can bring great value to companies who want to thrive passed the pandemic crisis and not just survive. Our practical and bespoke approach mixed with a splash of imagination can help companies reboot, rethink, and redefine who they are and what they can be.
