description: Research should be the absolute foundation for all brand planning. Sadly, most companies opt to bypass this phase as it is just another non-essential cost. Yes, it will cost you a few dollars, however, consider the cost of investing thousands behind campaigns, new business ventures and initiatives based on assumptions, conjecture or half of the picture. </br></br>As a result of the pandemic many companies are still struggling to find the right direction that points to new opportunities. Good research can also present insights that could point towards new business prospects. Think of it then as a compass or beacon, that’s saying, “Come and get it”.</br></br>So whether you need an informal brand health check, focus groups or more formal qualitative /quantitative types of research, at some stage you need research to help you make smarter and better decisions and the Stämpfli Consortium can help.
