description: Research should be the absolute foundation for all brandplanning. <br><br>Sadly, most companies opt to bypass this phase as just anotheradditional cost. Yes it can cost you a some “dollars and pennies” but considerthe cost of investing thousands behind campaigns and initiatives with only halfof the picture. <br><br>We firmly recommend that before you look to engage in anyform of brand activity that you start with real usable knowledge of yourcustomers, your competitors and the market before shaping a strategy. Research can take the form of informal BrandHealth Checks as a start progress to more formal in depth qualitative /quantitative research. <br><br>So, if you are still questioning if research is really necessary just remember that the most effective brand campaigns have always been the ones that based on research and brand truth.
